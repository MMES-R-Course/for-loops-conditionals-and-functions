### Creating a new shapefile

1. Using the locations from Boundary_points.csv as your guide, create a polygon shapefile 2 different ways
    - Create from scratch using editing tools
    - Minimum boundary geometry tool
    
2. Create a grid of points 50m apart using the polygon from #1 as an extent mask.  

3. Add an ID field to the point shapefile and fill with sequential integers (hint: python helpers).

4. Add the steer bathymetry data to each point.

The final point shapefile you just created will be used for the following interpolations.

5. Create an interpolated bathymetry raster using the IDW method.

6. Create an interpolated bathymetry raster using the Krigging method.

Now repeat 2-6.  Instead, this time create a grid of points 5m apart.  Inspect all the interpolated outputs and compare and contrast.
